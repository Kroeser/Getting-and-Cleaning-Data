# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
## Week 4 - Peer-graded assignment
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The endgoal was to prepare a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis. 

## Data used in this project
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data used in this projects is collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The raw data can be found here:

## Contents of this repository
This repository contains the following content:
1) a tidy data set, [tidyData.txt](tidyData.txt), that was created with the run_analysis.R script;
2) a [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) script that takes the raw data as input and creates the tidy data set; and 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the raw data called [CodeBook.md](CodeBook.md).
